# color-to-background
A simple javascript bookmarklet that allows you to enter the hex code (hexadecimal code) or name for any color and the background of the webpage will change to it. (Currently only tested on a mobile version of Safari because I wrote this on a road trip)



Steps to use: bookmark a regular page like "google.com" and edit the name/title to any name you like. Replace the URL box with the contents of the bookmarklet file and click save. Then tap/click on your bookmarklet and it should run, from there just enter the hex code or name of the desired color and the background will change.
